                <p>Drone technologies have a big impact on our today’s life and futuristic life, it is really helpful and we benefit a lot from them and simplify our tasks and jobs</p>
                <p>The current situation is that in our days drone technology has covered almost all working areas, drones have about 40 uses. These Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are very helpful and can change the way we live and do things.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this investigation was to investigate on drone technology and determine how drone technology could change or impact your life in security services and to show some of the advantages of these drones and how it is used in security services as it takes less effort to handle these machines and how it is being better and useful than human beings.</p>
                <p>The focus of this investigation was to see what people think about drones and how they think that drones could help us and be helpful and even take over us.</p>

                <h2>Why do companies use drones and not humans?</h2>
                    <p>They allow security teams to perform monitoring tasks more quickly and efficiently.  (Canler, May 02,2022)</p>
                <h2>Is a drone less expensive than hiring a human?</h2>
                    <p>Drones can be also really expensive like $200k and, the drone isn’t the only cost.  (McNabb, April 04,2017)</p>
                <h2>Are drones easier to handle than humans?</h2>
                    <p>Drones are so much easy to handle and you can have full control.  (kikudi, May 21,2022)</p>
            <h1>Findings</h1>
                <hr/>
                <img src="image/chart.jpg" class="recommendation">
                <h2>Recommendation:</h2>
                    <p>So as we have seen in our research that drones are also very useful in security services so I think if everyone agrees with drone and let them in their lives we can really get far and simplify our lives.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                    <p>Drones are also part of security service as they offer many advantages even if they can be a bit expensive but when we compare It with their helpfulness we realize that it not that expensive and can do a job that more than 10 people could have done in less time with many facilities as it’s easy to manipulate, and I think if everyone gets to trust drone we can get far not only with security service but with every other field out there, drones are the way to the future.</p>
